Running the Chatbot app:

  1) Just make a Cohere API key (-> go to Cohere webpage -> login -> go to key -> generate a new api key )
  2) make a env file in the root of the folder and add a variable as "COHERE_API_KEY = <your-api-key>"  and  "PORT=<your local-port>"
  3) start the server by running the server.js file (use node server.js)
  4) open the index.html in a browser
  5) type any query in the input field and Click "Ask!" to get the response
